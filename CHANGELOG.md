# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

The release workflow reads the section matching the version in `pyproject.toml`
and uses it as the GitHub Release body, so each version needs a heading of the
form `## [x.y.z] - YYYY-MM-DD`.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- `activity(..., id=N)` is now `activity(..., activity_id=N)`. The keyword
  shadowed the `id` builtin; the `Activity.id` field itself is unchanged.
- The bundled `pytest-given-authoring` skill now documents the report mechanics
  its rules depend on (story binding, coverage matching, lint severities), adds
  a symptom index, and groups the scenario rules under subheads.

### Fixed

- The bundled authoring skill's glossary-discovery advice: `conftest.py` must
  bind the `Glossary` / `FileGlossary` handle itself, not merely import the
  module defining it, or the report's Glossary tab stays empty.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-08

First public release.

### Added

- `@scenario` decorator plus `given` / `when` / `then` step blocks, usable as
  both context managers and decorators, including on fixtures.
- Self-contained interactive HTML report (`--given-html`), Markdown report
  (`--given-md`), and JSON report (`--given-json`). The HTML bundles Alpine.js
  and needs no server or external assets.
- Structured step text: plain strings, `Template` objects, and t-strings
  ([PEP 750](https://peps.python.org/pep-0750/)), with parameter interpolation
  rendered as highlighted values.
- `attach()` for text and JSON attachments on a step.
- Domain Storytelling support: ubiquitous-language glossaries (inline or
  Markdown-backed via `FileGlossary`), Domain Stories, and story coverage.
- Narration lint (`--given-lint`) with a configurable rule catalog via
  `given_lint_rules` and `given_lint_ignore`.
- `--given-source-link` with `vscode`, `cursor`, `zed`, `pycharm`, and `github`
  presets for jumping from a report step to its source.
- `pytest-given` console script: `report` to re-render a saved JSON report, and
  `skills install` to mirror the bundled agent skills into a project's
  `.claude/skills/`.
- Bundled authoring, navigating, and reviewing skills for AI agents, shipped in
  the wheel and version-matched to the plugin.
